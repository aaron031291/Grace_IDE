# 🧠 Grace IDE — Cognitive Development Environment

Welcome to **Grace IDE**, the first development environment built for intelligent, ethical, and self-aware systems.

Grace IDE isn’t just another code editor. It’s the cognitive shell around **Grace**, a sovereign AI architecture designed for trust, evolution, and resilience. This IDE was built to reflect that intelligence — with live cognition panels, forensic feedback, memory integration, and secure execution baked in.

## ⚙️ Features

### 🔐 Secure File Operations
- Full cross-platform file engine (Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, Android)
- Operation logging, backup versioning, and checksum validation
- File sandboxing and path validation for mobile environments

### 📁 Modular Execution
- Run, test, and validate code with safe subprocess isolation
- Supports Python execution with auto-cleanup and timeout guards
- Live storage stats and operation history included

### 🔎 Cognitive Security Engine
- Bandit + custom rules for vulnerability scanning
- Hardcoded secret detection (API keys, tokens, AWS credentials)
- Dependency scanning and crypto algorithm analysis
- Auto-fix + quarantine modes for critical files

### 📡 Live Cognition Interface
- WebSocket-ready panel for scanning, reporting, and secure interaction
- Progress callbacks and vulnerability dashboards (Grace UI integrated)

### 🧠 Lightning + Fusion Memory Hooks *(Coming Soon)*
